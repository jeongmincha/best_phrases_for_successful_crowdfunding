an idea to
on it and
the question is
you and a
you the chance
with the other
only one person
long as it
by the time
of your support
can not wait
order to win
can give you
the idea for
idea for the
a game about
you would be
sure the game
will have its
have its own
that you see
the first and
we have started
game as soon
in a few
with a single
game you are
you are playing
with just a
have been creating
creating a new
about a year
very best to
will not get
chance to be
the trials of
years we have
have been playing
game for you
none of us
work together with
game we have
we ask for
we get funded
a little extra
to test the
you can watch
game of the
the skills and
and if they
be forced to
and he has
is not yet
matter of time
to the design
spotter playing card
us shipping included
will contact you
make sure they
the risk is
that anyone can
on a few
creation of this
lot of work
i ca wait
come to fruition
with a strong
not only will
and give them
costs will be
order to ensure
to complete this
are as follows
will depend on
will be producing
two versions of
version of this
the level of
even if we
that is to
would allow us
to listen to
are hoping to
and we would
turned into a
to in the
the stretch tarot
of the stretch
together in a
is intended to
of the entire
that i was
to be at
people like you
the cost to

making this a
use in the
to spread the
have been taken
in completing the
completing the project
to keep them

get the project
this game but
would be an
i can see
this game as
play with friends
up the game
we believe we
